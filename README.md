Build a blog app with django and angular

I think I would find it useful as well as a good way to learn

While learning django with the polls app from the tutorial, a lot of the other pages for reading include examples that would be appropriate as pieces of a blog app.

Currently, working on a mostly duplicated polls (now called poll) app, and figuring out how to write a simple blog app. Then, once that's up and running, I'll be doing the angular tutorial I found here https://thinkster.io/django-angularjs-tutorial (sorry I'm a cheapo).. I'll probably do that in a separate django project and then as I find changes that would be good to integrate into the blog and poll app I'll do in the project django_angular. This way I have the freedom to experiment in this repo without sacrificing the integrity of the django-journey repo and the as-yet-unnamed repo that I will use for the django-angularjs-tutorial
