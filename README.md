# django-angular
Build a social network with django and angular.

I think I would find it fun as well as a good way to learn django and using a frontend framework (angular) with it.

While learning django with the polls app from the tutorial, a lot of the other pages for reading include examples that would be appropriate as pieces of a blog app.

Currently, wrote the simple blog app alongside the poll(s) tutorial app. I've started a ground-up tutorial on JavaScript from MDN (repo: javasciprt). Next, I'll be doing the angular tutorial I found here https://thinkster.io/django-angularjs-tutorial and probably purchasing their training course material to help speed learning.. I'll do that in a separate django project and then as I find changes that would be good to integrate into the social network, like the blog and poll app, I'll do it in the project django_angular. This way I have the freedom to experiment in this repo without sacrificing the integrity of the django-journey repo and the as-yet-unnamed repo that I will use for the django-angularjs-tutorial
